Example step by step setup commands,

sh-4.1# mkdir /opt/LuoYun2_Src
sh-4.1# cd /opt/LuoYun2_Src/
sh-4.1# cp /home/dongwu/luoyun-cloud/luoyun-cloud-0.1.tar.gz .
sh-4.1# tar xzf luoyun-cloud-0.1.tar.gz 
sh-4.1# cd luoyun-cloud-0.1
sh-4.1# ./configure --prefix=/opt/LuoYun2_Src/Install 
...
sh-4.1# make
...
sh-4.1# make install
sh-4.1# cd /opt/LuoYun2_Src/Install/

Here's the standard description,

1. The first step is to run the configure script, which can be as
   simple as

    ./configure

   However, it's recommeneded to specify a prefix so that when doing
   "make install", all the files are installed into the specified 
   directory. Developers in LuoYun Corp. use the following command as
   root,

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/luoyun

2. The second step is very simple, just run "make"

    make

3. The third step is to install the applications ans supporting files,

    make install

   If you have specified "prefix" in the first step, all the files will
   be installed to the specified directory. Otherwise, the files will be
   installed to directories per Linux standard. For example, executables
   will be installed into /usr/local/bin, config files go to /etc, etc.


Enjoy!
